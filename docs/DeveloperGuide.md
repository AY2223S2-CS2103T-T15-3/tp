### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/vimification/taskui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The `UI` consists of a `MainScreen` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandInput`, `TaskDetailPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `CommandInput` etc. All these, including the `MainScreen`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework but is modeled to mimic after the structure of the `React.js` framework as closely as possible. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainScreen`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/vimification/taskui/MainScreen.java) is specified in [`MainScreen.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainScreen.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- communicates with back-end via a single-entry point `Logic` component to exectue user commands.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands and to display the list of tasks.
- updates the UI every time a command is executed.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `VimificationParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<!-- The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call. -->

<!-- ![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/> -->

How the parsing works:

- Each command has a dedicated parser, `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) to parse it.
- The main entry point of the parser, `VimificationParser` , combines the command parsers together.
- When called upon to parse a user command, the `VimificationParser` class tries to parse different prefixes. Each prefixes maps to a single `XYZCommandParser` which parses the remaining user input and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `VimificationParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `CommandParser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the data i.e., all `Task` objects.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both task data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `TaskListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `vimificationbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Parser

#### ApplicativeParser

The parser of Vimification is implemented with `ApplicativeParser` instead of `Regex`. `ApplicativeParser` is an idea from function programming language, where we have a set of **combinators**, and we can combine these combinators with the power of Applicative and/or Monad to form more powerful combinators.

The main reason why we used `ApplicativeParser` is because it is easier to read and maintain.

`ApplicativeParser` can be implemented as a wrapper around a function that accepts some input sequence, and returns an container that represents one of these possibilities:

- The parser fails, and the container is empty.
- The parser succeeds, and the container contains the remaining input sequence, togerther with the parsing result.

In the current implementation, the container used is `Optional` from the Java standard library. One problem with `Optional` is that it cannot contain error infomation, and we currently have to use `Exception` for that purpose. However, `Exception` may create unpredictable control flow, and must be used with care.

When an `Exception` is thrown, the parser will stop immediately and control is returned to the caller. This prevents the parser from trying a different alternative, and is undesirable for some combinators, such as `ApplicativeParser#or()`, `ApplicativeParser#many()` and `ApplicativeParser#many1()`.

The input sequence used (internally) by `ApplicativeParser` is `StringView`, a thin wrapper class representing a slice on a `String`. This choice is purely for performance reason - consuming input with `StringView` is much faster as we only need to change the offsets stored in the `StringView`, instead of having to copy the entire substring into a new `String`.

Some basic combinators of `ApplicativeParser` is provided using static factory methods.

#### CommandParser

The combinators of `ApplicativeParser` will be combined and used in `CommandParser` to parse different commands of the application.

A class implementing `CommandParser` must provide an implementation for `CommandParser#getInternalParser()`. This method will return the appropriate `ApplicativeParser` combinator to be used inside `CommandParser#parse()`.

Notice the signature of `CommandParser#getInternalParser()`: this method returns an `ApplicativeParser<ApplicativeParser<LogicCommand>>`. The nested `ApplicativeParser` is necessary in this case - the first level will parse the command prefix, and returns a combinator dedicated to parse the particular command identified by the prefix. The remaining input is then piped to the second level (the combinator returned before) to construct the command.

This implementation allows us to fail early and report errors if the prefix does not represent any command, or quickly parse the command without having to try multiple alternatives.

### Storage

#### Represent inheritance relationship

`Task` and its subclasses have can be converted from and to JSON format using `JsonAdoptedXYZ` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific task name e.g., `Todo`).

We need to translate the inheritance relationship between `Task` and its subclasses from and to JSON. The current implementation uses 2 annotations (from the Jackson library), `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` to solve this.

One downside of this implementation is that `JsonAdoptedTask` must know all of its subclasses, which increases coupling. However, after considering another alternative (manually setup the json parser), this seems to be the most suitable implementation for the current scale of the project. The increase in coupling is compensated by the ease of implementation.

### \[Proposed\] Modification compared to AB3

AB3 uses the **Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC)** design pattern. One detail we observed is that the `Model` uses `ObservableList` to carry application data, however, we argued that this is not the optimal design, since `ObservableList` should be used for `view`. AB3 implementation makes the view and bussiness logic bundled together, hinder our development speed.

Therefore, we wish to improve the current design of the application. \<The design will be finalized soon\>.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
